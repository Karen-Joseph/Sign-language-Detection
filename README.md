# Sign Language Detection 🖐️🤖

This project uses deep learning and computer vision to recognize and classify hand gestures in real-time, enabling basic sign language interpretation through a webcam or image input.

## 🔍 Overview
The goal of this project is to bridge the communication gap for the hearing impaired by using AI to understand sign language gestures. The system uses a trained neural network to detect hand signs and display the predicted output live.
